# Augmented Reality Screen PCB

This project includes the work-in-progress PCB that I am making to have augmented reality glasses like the Nreal Air's. This PCB will use a Olimex ESP32 PEO and a STM8S105K6T6C. This is a work-in-progress and is far from being done, but the schematic has been finished so far.
